# 0x13. JavaScript - Objects, Scopes, and Closures

## Description

Welcome to the 0x13. JavaScript - Objects, Scopes, and Closures project repository! This project dives deeper into JavaScript, focusing on more advanced topics such as objects, scopes, and closures. These concepts are essential for writing efficient and maintainable JavaScript code, especially in more complex applications.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand and use objects in JavaScript.
- Work with the `this` keyword and understand its context.
- Create and manipulate object methods.
- Utilize closures to create private variables and functions.
- Understand the scope chain and variable hoisting.
- Write concise and efficient JavaScript code using ES6 features.
