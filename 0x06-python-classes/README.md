# 0x06. Python - Classes and Objects

## Description

This project is part of the ALX Higher Level Programming curriculum. It explores the concept of classes and objects in Python, covering the basics of object-oriented programming (OOP).

## Files

1. [0-square.py](./0-square.py) - Empty Python class `Square` that defines a square.
2. [1-square.py](./1-square.py) - Python class `Square` with an instantiation method that sets the size of the square.
3. [2-square.py](./2-square.py) - Python class `Square` with getter and setter for the `size` attribute.
4. [3-square.py](./3-square.py) - Python class `Square` with methods to calculate the area of the square.
5. [4-square.py](./4-square.py) - Python class `Square` with additional methods to set and get the value of `size`.
6. [5-square.py](./5-square.py) - Python class `Square` with a method that prints the square using the `#` character.
7. [6-square.py](./6-square.py) - Python class `Square` with a method that prints the square using a custom character.
8. [100-singly_linked_list.py](./100-singly_linked_list.py) - Python class `Node` that defines a singly linked list.

## How to Use

Each file corresponds to a specific task. Instructions on how to run or use each file are provided within the task's directory.

## Best Practices for Classes and Objects

- **Class Naming**: Follow PEP 8 guidelines for naming classes. Class names should use the CapWords convention.

- **Attributes**: Define attributes within the `__init__` method. Use self to refer to instance variables.

- **Encapsulation**: Encapsulate attributes by using getter and setter methods. This allows controlled access to the class attributes.

- **Methods**: Use meaningful names for methods, and ensure that each method has a clear purpose within the context of the class.

- **Docstrings**: Include docstrings to describe the purpose and usage of the class and its methods.
