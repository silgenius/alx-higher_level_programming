## Projects

### 0x00. Python - Hello, World

- [0x00-python-hello_world](./0x00-python-hello_world/README.md)
- Description: This project is an introduction to Python programming. It covers topics like printing, indentation, variables, and more.

### 0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions

- [0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions](./0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions/README.md)
- Description: This project delves deeper into Python programming, focusing on conditional statements, loops, and functions.

### 0x02-python-import_modules

- [0x02-python-import_modules](./0x02-python-import_modules/README.md)
- The files within this directory explore the usage of modules in Python and how to import them. Modules allow for the organization of code into reusable, separate files, enhancing code readability and maintainability.

### 0x03-python-data_structures

- [0x03-python-data_structures](./0x03-python-data_structures/README.md)
- This directory contains Python scripts that delve into various data structures such as lists, tuples, and dictionaries. Understanding these data structures is crucial for organizing and manipulating data effectively in Python.

### 0x04. Python - more_data_structures

- [0x04-python-more_data_structures](./0x04-python-more_data_structures/README.md)
- Description: This project extends the exploration of Python data structures, introducing concepts such as sets and dictionary comprehensions.

### 0x05. Python - exceptions

- [0x05-python-exceptions](./0x05-python-exceptions/README.md)
- Description: This project focuses on handling exceptions in Python, including the use of `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to manage errors in code.

### 0x06. Python - classes

- [0x06-python-classes](./0x06-python-classes/README.md)
- Description: This project delves into the concept of classes and objects in Python, covering the basics of object-oriented programming (OOP).

### 0x07. Python - test_driven_development

- [0x07-python-test_driven_development](./0x07-python-test_driven_development/README.md)
- Description: This project introduces the principles of Test-driven development (TDD) in Python, where tests are written before the actual code to ensure correctness.

### 0x08. Python - more_classes

- [0x08-python-more_classes](./0x08-python-more_classes/README.md)
- Description: This project builds upon the previous classes project, introducing advanced concepts such as class methods, static methods, class inheritance, and more.

### 0x09. Python - everything_is_object

- [0x09-python-everything_is_object](./0x09-python-everything_is_object/README.md)
- Description: This project explores the concept of objects in Python, emphasizing that everything in Python is an object, including variables, functions, and even classes.

### 0x0A. Python - inheritance

- [0x0A-python-inheritance](./0x0A-python-inheritance/README.md)
- Description: This project focuses on the concept of inheritance in Python, allowing for the creation of new classes that are based on existing classes.

### 0x0B. Python - input_output

- [0x0B-python-input_output](./0x0B-python-input_output/README.md)
- Description: This project covers input and output operations in Python, including file handling, reading and writing to files, and using the `json` format.

### 0x0C. Python - almost_a_circle

- [0x0C-python-almost_a_circle](./0x0C-python-almost_a_circle/README.md)
- Description: This project involves creating a base class and several subclasses to represent geometric shapes, focusing on testing and documentation.
