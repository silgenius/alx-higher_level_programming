# 0x0E. SQL - More Queries

## Description

Welcome to the 0x0E. SQL - More Queries project repository! This project builds upon the fundamentals of SQL learned in previous projects and introduces more advanced SQL queries and operations. The exercises and tasks will cover topics such as data filtering, aggregation, joins, subqueries, and managing users and permissions in a relational database.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand and use complex SQL queries to retrieve and manipulate data.
- Utilize different types of joins to combine data from multiple tables.
- Write subqueries to perform nested queries.
- Implement data aggregation using GROUP BY, HAVING, and aggregate functions.
- Manage database users, roles, and permissions.
- Optimize queries for better performance.
