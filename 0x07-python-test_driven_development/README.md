# 0x07. Python - Test-driven development

## Description

This project is part of the ALX Higher Level Programming curriculum. It focuses on the principles of Test-driven development (TDD) in Python. TDD involves writing tests before writing the code, ensuring that the code meets the specified requirements.

## Files

1. [0-add_integer.py](./0-add_integer.py) - Python function that adds two integers. Includes corresponding test file [tests/0-add_integer.txt](./tests/0-add_integer.txt).
2. [2-matrix_divided.py](./2-matrix_divided.py) - Python function that divides all elements of a matrix. Includes corresponding test file [tests/2-matrix_divided.txt](./tests/2-matrix_divided.txt).
3. [3-say_my_name.py](./3-say_my_name.py) - Python function that prints a formatted string with a person's name. Includes corresponding test file [tests/3-say_my_name.txt](./tests/3-say_my_name.txt).
4. [4-print_square.py](./4-print_square.py) - Python function that prints a square with the character `#`. Includes corresponding test file [tests/4-print_square.txt](./tests/4-print_square.txt).
5. [5-text_indentation.py](./5-text_indentation.py) - Python function that adds two integers. Includes corresponding test file [tests/5-text_indentation.txt](./tests/5-text_indentation.txt).

## How to Use

Each file corresponds to a specific task. Instructions on how to run or use each file are provided within the task's directory.

To run the tests for a specific task, use the following command:

```bash
python -m doctest -v file_name.py
