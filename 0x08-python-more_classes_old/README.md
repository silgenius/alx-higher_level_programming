# 0x08. Python - More Classes and Objects

## Description

This project is part of the ALX Higher Level Programming curriculum. It expands on the concepts of classes and objects in Python, covering advanced topics such as class methods, static methods, class inheritance, and more.

## Files

1. [0-rectangle.py](./0-rectangle.py) - Empty Python class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle.
2. [1-rectangle.py](./1-rectangle.py) - Python class `Rectangle` with an instantiation method that sets the width and height of the rectangle.
3. [2-rectangle.py](./2-rectangle.py) - Python class `Rectangle` with getter and setter methods for the `width` and `height` attributes.
4. [3-rectangle.py](./3-rectangle.py) - Python class `Rectangle` with methods to calculate the area and perimeter of the rectangle.
5. [4-rectangle.py](./4-rectangle.py) - Python class `Rectangle` with additional methods to represent the rectangle with `#` characters.
6. [5-rectangle.py](./5-rectangle.py) - Python class `Rectangle` with a method that prints the rectangle using `str()` and `repr()`.
7. [6-rectangle.py](./6-rectangle.py) - Python class `Rectangle` with a class attribute `number_of_instances` to keep track of the number of instances created.
8. [7-rectangle.py](./7-rectangle.py) - Python class `Rectangle` with a class attribute `print_symbol` to represent the rectangle in the `str()` method.
9. [8-rectangle.py](./8-rectangle.py) - Python class `Rectangle` with a static method `largest_or_equal` that compares two rectangles and returns the larger one.
10. [9-rectangle.py](./9-rectangle.py) - Python class `Rectangle` with a class method `square` that creates a square rectangle.

## How to Use

Each file corresponds to a specific task. Instructions on how to run or use each file are provided within the task's directory.

## Best Practices for More Classes and Objects

- **Class Naming**: Follow PEP 8 guidelines for naming classes. Class names should use the CapWords convention.

- **Attributes**: Define attributes within the `__init__` method. Use self to refer to instance variables.

- **Encapsulation**: Encapsulate attributes by using getter and setter methods. This allows controlled access to the class attributes.

- **Methods**: Use meaningful names for methods, and ensure that each method has a clear purpose within the context of the class.

- **Class and Static Methods**: Understand the difference between class and static methods and use them appropriately based on the behavior you want.

- **Inheritance**: When using inheritance, ensure that the child class represents an "is-a" relationship with the parent class.
